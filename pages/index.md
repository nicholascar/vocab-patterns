# Vocab Patterns
### Nicholas J. Car

## A pattern catalogue for modelling vocabularies with 
## [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) and a few other, well-known, [OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) ontologies.

### Where to start:

If you are new to vocabulary modelling, start with the [Introduction](/intro) page. If you want to get right to the heart of the patterns, start with the [Patterns Index](/patterns).
