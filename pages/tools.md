## Vocab Tools

Here is a simple listing of tools relevant to vocabylary modelling and use:

* [VocPub Profile]()
    * _coming!_
* [SKOS Null Profile]()
    * a 'null' profile of SKOS, that is, a profile that imposes no additional requirements
    * its purpose is to provide a SKOS data validator that can be used to check if data is SKOS-compliant
    * note that many of the patterns in this list have more refined requirements than just pure SKOS. Their requirements are captured in the VocPub profile
* [pySHACL](https://github.com/RDFLib/pySHACL)
    * A Python validator for Semantic Web Data
    * pySHACL can be used to validate vocabulary data formulated in RDF according to data 'shapes'
    * some patterns in this catalogue reference relevant shapes that can be used to test for that pattern
* [SHACL Playground](https://shacl.org/playground/)
    * an online constraint validator for the SHACL, written in JavaScript
* [Zazuko SHACL Playground](https://shacl-playground.zazuko.com/)
    * an newer, online, constraint validator for the SHACL, written in JavaScript
