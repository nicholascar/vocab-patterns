## Language labels for a Concept

### Context

In English, a _dog_ is a four legged animal that in German is known as a _Hund_ and in Polish as a _pies_. We wish to link all these multilingual labels to the same `Concept`.

### Solution

Use multiple SKOS `prefLabel` properties to indicate the preferred label for the `Concept` 'dog', using RDF language indicators to separate them, e.g. `@en` (English), `@pl` (Polish).

### Example

```
:dog
    a skos:Concept ;
    skos:prefLabel 
        "dog"@en ,
        "Hund"@de ,
        "pies"@en ;
.
```

### Discussion

Do not use SKOS `altLabel` values for alternative language labels. `altLabel` should be used for alternative labels in the same language as a primary, `prefLabel`. See [Pattern: Alt Labels]({{ site.baseurl }}/pattern/001) for more details.
