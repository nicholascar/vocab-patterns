## Alternative labels for a Concept

### Context

In English, a _dog_ might also be called a _hound_ and even, archicially, a _cur_. We want to ensure that the same `Concept` is referenced via each label however we also wish to indicate that _dog_ is the primary label and that the others are of lesser status.

### Solution

In SKOS, the property `prefLabel` is used to indicate a primary, preferred, label and the property  `altLabel` is used to indicate alternative labels.

### Example

```
:dog
    a skos:Concept ;
    skos:prefLabel "dog" ;
    skos:altLabel 
        "dog" ,
        "hound" ,
        "cur" ;
.
```

### Discussion

`altLabel` instances can indicate their language, but if a `Concept` needs to have multiple language labels, multiple insances of `prefLabel` should be used, as per [Pattern: Language Labels]({{ site.baseurl }}/pattern/002).
